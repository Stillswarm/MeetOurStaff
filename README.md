## Notes on my App Objectives
- I created this app to apply my knowledge of app design with architectural patterns.
- My primary motive was to develop an application where there is a complete separation of concerns between the data layer and the UI layer.
- In the UI layer, all state-holding variables are immutably defined in a separate data class.
- The communication between the UI elements and UI state is achieved through a ViewModel.
- In the data layer, I have provided a repository class that lets you safely access all the relevant data from the data source.
- IMP: As I am still in my learning phase, some of the code I've written may be weak, unnecessary, or even wrong. I will continue improving the architecture of this app as I delve deeper.
